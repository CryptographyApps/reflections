What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git directory is created. To let git know to begin tracking
	the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area contains the files from the working directory that you
	wish to track but are not yet commited to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	After making the logical change use git add to place the files you
	worked on to the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	
	Very helpful for making changes that you are unsure of. Perfect for 
	keeping the working code working.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Showing the commits as nodes on the diagram and creating branches 
	from those nodes allows you to visualize how different branches
	relate to one another.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
	The result for me was breaking the game. Who the fuck knows?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	After a number of commits have been made much of the code won't change
	on future commits so allowing Git to merge automatically will save
	quite a bit of time for the coder vs doing it manually.
